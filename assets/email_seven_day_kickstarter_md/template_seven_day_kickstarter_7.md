day: 7
title: The community


# Welcome to the community.
  
On our last day of this email series, we're going to talk about the power of community to help motivate us and help keep us inspired and on-track with our goals.     

Community is an overlooked aspect of the porn addiction recovery process. Certainly, during my porn recovery journey I felt that receiving help from others was a sign of weakness, and in fact indicated that I was less capable as a person at dealing with my own problems.

The funny thing is that this sentiment couldn't have been further from the truth, and a strong sense of community and asking for help is actually one of the most powerful things you can do as an individual to influence the development of healthy coping mechanisms within your life.

NeverFap Deluxe offers a wide range of options for people to get involved with like-minded individuals, as well as interact with my dear self for tips, advice and all things porn recovery strategy. 


## Discord channel.
    

Most prominent is our Discord channel, a dedicated space for porn addicts to discuss strategy, seek support and keep track of their progress in our #accountability channel.

Aside from building the website, this is where I spend a majority of my time liasing with the community, as well as building our fantastic NeverFap Deluxe Bot, which is designed to do a huge number of things.

For example it keeps track of all your accountability posts, it sends you messages once you've posted, it lets you know if people have reacted to your post, it will remind you if you haven't been posting in a while, in addition to a heap of other helpful things.

Essentially how it works is that users will post in the #accountability channel, with a list of the healthy coping mechanisms and how they aim to improve them, which helps people commit to their mental health practices.

Certainly, it's worth checking out if you believe you would benefit from an accountability partner, not to mention I'll be there as well!

## Subreddit.


In addition to the channel, we also have an official subreddit r/NeverFapDeluxe where you're more-than welcome to join in the conversation.

We currently don't have a crazy amount of subscribers, however it's early days and we mostly use it as a platform to post PR announcements such as the release of new podcast episodes or Patreon updates.            

Certainly, your support is appreciated!
